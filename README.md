Welcome to the [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) pwa-starter! Looking to build a new [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) and not sure where to get started? This is what you are looking for! The pwa-starter includes everything you need to start building a production ready PWA and follows all best practices. You get:

- lazy-loaded routes using [@vaadin/router](https://vaadin.com/router).
- A 100 on [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), giving you a great starting point for performance and accessibility.
- Use [lit-element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) to build your PWA. lit-element gives you all of the developer experience of React with all   the benefits of Web Components such as smaller bundles for faster load times.
- Includes the [PWABuilder pwa-install component](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-install#pwa-install) for an app store like PWA install experience.
- [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) for service workers along with the [PWABuilder pwa-update component](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-update#pwa-update) to give your PWA a great offline experience.
